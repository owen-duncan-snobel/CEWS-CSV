# CEWS-CSV

All the data from CEWS Employer Search Results converted into a CSV for quick searches. It has been split by | (It should be noted that not every business had a seperate organization name) Each new line was a seperate request that was granted through the [CEWS](https://apps.cra-arc.gc.ca/ebci/hacc/cews/srch/pub/fllLstSrh?dsrdPg=0&q.ordrClmn=NAME&q.ordrRnk=ASC).

Feel free to contibute to update the file. I was going to start for the larger businesses add a column for the revenues of each respective company where applicable and able to search for. (Publicly traded / non-profits where incomes were disclosed) 

Look at / download the CSV file [here](https://github.com/owen-duncan-snobel/CEWS-CSV/blob/master/CEWS.csv)
